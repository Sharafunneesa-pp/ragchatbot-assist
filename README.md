# RAG-Based Chatbot with Document Search

This is a **web-based conversational AI** application that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for answering questions based on documents (e.g., PDFs) stored in a local directory. The application uses **OpenAI's GPT model** for generating responses and integrates **FAISS** for efficient document similarity search. It provides an interactive chat interface and retrieves relevant documents to assist with answering user queries.
