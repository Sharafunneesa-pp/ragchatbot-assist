A broad sample (N > 1,600) of secondary level I pupils of two age groups \\nand various academic backgrounds in Germany was studied. \\n \\nDesign and Methods: While the research background (methodology, statistical analyses, results) has been reported \\nelsewhere (Kuhn, 2010; Kuhn & Müller, 2014), the main objective of the present contribution is to provide a detailed \\naccount of the practical aspects of the approach (examples, classroom implementation, etc.). \\nTwo concrete, curriculum-relevant classroom teaching experiments based on newspaper story problems are reported, \\ncombined with a quasi-experimental study comparing NSPs against conventional textbook problems. They covered two \\ntopics and two related age groups (elementary kinematics, 7th/8th grade; energy, 9th/10th grade). The implementation of \\nthe teaching-learning sequence in classroom practice is described in detail, especially the design principles of “embedded \\ndata”, “adjustable problem complexity”, and “active and autonomous problem solving”. For the empirical investigation, \\nresearch-validated instruments for various motivational and learning outcomes were used, in particular for perceived \\nauthenticity/link to real life and for transfer.

The entire development and research project was carried out in a research-practice \\nco-operation network for physics education, including more than 20 teachers from six different types of school. \\nAdditionally, tasks types similar to NSPs, but using other ways of contextualisation (e.g. advertisements) will be \\ndiscussed as perspective. \\n \\nResults: A considerable improvement in motivation was found, which proved stable at least in the medium term. \\nLearning turned out to also be fostered to a sizeable extent, including the educationally important issue of transfer. \\nMoreover, these positive effects were “robust” in the sense of not being affected (or only weakly so) by potentially \\nrelevant pupil characteristics (such as gender, or language-, maths- and physics-related academic ability). \\n \\nConclusions: The use of NSPs as a form of CBSE can have large positive, robust, and sustainable effects of both \\nmotivation and learning. Being flexible and practical to implement, they appear thus highly suited to classroom \\napplication.

INTRODUCTION  \\nThe present work starts off from a set of closely \\nrelated, widespread problems in science education.1 \\nFirst, students’ transfer of knowledge, especially to real-\\nlife contexts, is low. Indeed, even when knowledge in \\n                                                             \\n1 While this specific study was on physics education, many of its \\nstatements and findings also hold for science education in general. \\nsome initial learning context is successfully acquired, \\nstudents fail at application and transfer problems outside \\nsaid context. Such “inert knowledge” has long been \\nidentified as a central problem of science education and \\neducational psychology (Renkl 1996; Renkl et al., 1996; \\nWhitehead, \\n1929). \\nSecond, \\nsense-making \\nand \\nknowledgeable usage of science-related texts has been \\nfound wanting. These two problems have recently been \\nconfirmed, for example, by large-scale assessment \\nstudies. This has been particularly striking in the case of \\n \\nNewspaper story problems \\n2 \\n \\nstudents in Germany (Baumert et al., 2001; 2002). Third, \\nthese problems are embedded within the general problem \\nof students’ low motivation for and (sometimes even \\nbasic) understanding of science in many countries. \\nStrong evidence of this is found in the ROSE (where the \\nfocus is on attitude/motivation; Sjoberg & Schreiber, \\n2010) and PISA (OECD 2010, Fig. I.3.19) studies. It is \\nhere that Context-Based Science Education (CBSE) \\ncomes into play. CBSE has a long history and is \\nadvocated as a highly promising approach, particularly \\nfor physics education (Duit & Mikelskis-Seifert, 2007; \\nTaasoobshirazi & Carr, 2008; Kuhn et al., 2010a) and \\nscience education in general (Fensham, 2009; Bennett et \\nal., 2007; Parchmann et al., 2006; Nentwig & \\nWaddington, 2005). In the current broad understanding, \\nCBSE is defined as “using concepts and process skills in \\nreal-life contexts that are relevant to students from \\ndiverse backgrounds” (Glynn & Koballa 2005, p.75). \\nMaking science issues relevant to students and their \\nsocial groups – their families and peers – or trying to do \\nso counters the wide-spread perception of physics \\n(especially) as being dry, impersonal, and irrelevant, and \\nthis is supposed to have positive effects both on \\nmotivation and learning. Moreover, CBSE should be \\ntargeted at students with “diverse backgrounds” (i.e., \\nwith a broad target groups), and its (supposed) benefits \\nshould not be restricted to a select student population.  \\nThe notion of “authenticity” – in the sense of a close \\nrelationship to real (or at least realistic) contexts \\nensuring “relevance to students’ interests and lives” – is \\nalso central to PISA’s understanding of scientific literacy \\n(OECD, 2007, p.36). Importantly here, such tasks are \\nusually not formulated in mathematical or scientific \\nterms, they refer to real-world events or objects, in \\ncommon, every-day language. Thus, a work of \\n“translation” \\nwith \\nterminological \\nand \\nconceptual \\nreframing must be carried out, representing a first step of \\ncognitive activation (OECD, 2006; Weiss & Müller, \\n2015). \\nDrawing on past research as well as on good practice \\nreports from mathematics, physics, and other science \\nclassrooms (Jarman & McClune, 2007), the present \\ncontribution deals with some specific ways of \\nestablishing such contexts, using science problems based \\non newspaper articles and the real-life contexts they \\nprovide (hereafter “newspaper story problems” or NSP), \\nsee Fig. 1. With the general goal being to bridge physics \\neducation research and classroom practice for the issues \\nunder consideration, the following objectives will be \\naddressed: \\n• to provide empirical evidence for NSPs’ reported \\npotential to improve both motivation and \\nlearning, including transfer, and thereby closing \\nthe existing research-practice gap (see abstract \\nand sect. 2) for a specific example of context-\\nbased physics education; \\n• to investigate whether such benefits, should they \\nexist, can in fact be established for more than a \\nshort-term duration, and for pupils2 from diverse \\n                                                             \\n2 “Pupil” is still currently used in British English (e.g., according to the \\nCambridge Dictionary: “a child at school”), and as it correctly \\ndifferentiates the institution (and age group) it is preferred to the \\nundifferentiated American English “student”. \\nbackgrounds, and in different teaching and school \\nsettings (for the latter aspect, key features of a \\nresearch-practice \\nco-operation \\nnetwork \\nfor \\nphysics education involving a total sample of \\nabout 1,600 pupils will be described); \\n• to give, of course, examples and more generally, \\nprinciples of classroom implementation for NSP, \\nenabling interested teachers to adapt them for \\ntheir own use; the present paper will mainly deal \\nwith NSP (on the topics of elementary kinematics \\nand energy (transformations) with a brief outlook \\non \\nsimilar \\ncontext-based \\nscience \\nlearning \\nactivities. \\n \\nWhile the research background (methodology, \\nstatistical analyses, results) has been reported elsewhere \\n(Kuhn, 2010; Kuhn & Müller, 2014), the main objective \\nof the present contribution is to provide a detailed \\naccount of the practical aspects of the approach \\n(examples, classroom implementation, etc.). \\n2. NEWSPAPER \\nSTORY \\nPROBLEMS: \\nBAKGROUND AND RATIONALE \\nEvidence in favour of CBSE has arisen from both \\nresearch and classroom practice. However, other results \\nin science education show that taking physics contexts \\ninto account in the sense of “making it relevant” \\n(Nentwig & Waddington, 2005) is not sufficient to \\nmaintain (nor generate) pupil interest. Figure 2 shows \\nthe development of interest in and perceived relevance of \\nphysics from 5th to 10th grade, that is, from beginning to \\nend of secondary level I in Germany (Muckenfuß, 1996). \\nA striking “scissor-shaped” pattern is visible: while \\nperceived relevance of physics increases over the years \\nconsidered, interest shows the marked drop we are all \\naware of and face in our daily teaching. This strong \\ndivergence of ascribed relevance and personal interest \\nhas been confirmed by the large-scale international \\nstudy, ROSE (Sjoberg & Schreiber, 2010). This finding \\ncan be interpreted in that from the end of childhood (5th \\ngrade) to young adulthood (10th grade), youths become \\nincreasingly aware of the relevance of physics (science) \\nfor the world they live in, but that does not entail \\npersonal relevance or interest. The latter being absent, \\none sees a decline of interest that is well established in \\ndevelopmental psychology studies for this age group in \\nscience and almost all other school subjects as well \\n(Häussler & Hoffmann, 1995; CHSN, 2009; Krapp & \\nPrenzel, 2011). \\nGiven this, at least two questions must be answered: \\nFirst, what contexts to choose, and second, how to \\nembed CBSE into classroom practice, so that it is in fact \\nperceived as interesting (and cognitively activating) by \\nthe pupils themselves. We will refer to these two \\nquestions in turn as kind of context, and classroom \\nimplementation, respectively. \\nIt is for the question raised by Fig. 2 that a specific \\nform of establishing contexts in the classroom comes \\ninto play, namely, “stories as context”. Embedding \\nlearning content in an interesting story is current and \\ngood practice in many science (and non-science) \\nclassrooms. One way of doing this is through newspaper \\n3 \\nAnonym (please do not fill in your name) \\n \\nstory problems. These are based on newspaper articles \\ncovering science related issues and ask pupils to work on \\nvarious \\nrelated \\nquestions \\nand \\ntasks.\\n \\nFig. 1. A newspaper story (a) and conventional (b) problem on the topic of electrical energy. Tasks are identical in both cases (c). \\n \\n \\nFig. 2. Development of interest (▲) in and perceived relevance \\n(o) of physics from beginning to end of secondary level I in \\nGermany; x-axis: 5th to 10th grade, y-axis: percentage of \\nmaximum possible (POMP; Cohen et al., 1999) of the scale in \\nquestion (Muckenfuß, 1996) \\nGiven this, at least two questions must be answered: \\nFirst, what contexts to choose, and second, how to \\nembed CBSE into classroom practice, so that it is in fact \\nperceived as interesting (and cognitively activating) by \\nthe pupils themselves. We will refer to these two \\nquestions in turn as kind of context, and classroom \\nimplementation, respectively. \\nIt is for the question raised by Fig. 2 that a specific \\nform of establishing contexts in the classroom comes \\ninto play, namely, “stories as context”. Embedding \\nlearning content in an interesting story is current and \\ngood practice in many science (and non-science) \\nclassrooms. One way of doing this is through newspaper \\nstory problems. These are based on newspaper articles \\ncovering science related issues and ask pupils to work on \\nvarious related questions and tasks. \\nNewspaper \\nstory \\nproblems \\nthus \\ninclude \\ntwo \\ncomponents: (i) an article (or excerpt) taken from a real \\nnewspaper and (ii) one or more tasks emerging from this \\ntext (see Fig. 1). To maintain a “flavour” of authenticity \\nand connection to the real world, these articles are used \\nwith little or no modification (give-or-take possible \\nediting for length). The rationale behind the use of NSPs \\nis, of course, that newspaper articles (almost by \\ndefinition) provide out-of-school, real-life contexts. \\nMoreover, journalists are supposed to be experts at \\nwriting interesting, high-quality stories (and it is a good \\nthing to use their know-how). An excellent introduction \\nand source of ideas on using newspapers to enrich \\nscience teaching is offered by Jarman and McClune \\n(2007). For various specific disciplines, reports of good \\npractice and sample collections for the use of \\nnewspapers exist (extensively in mathematics, (Paulos, \\n1995; Herget & Scholz 1998), and to some extent also \\nfor physics (Armbrust, 2001) and chemistry (Toby, \\n1997; Haupt, 2005). Jarman and McClune (2002) review \\nthe use and objectives of teaching science with \\nnewspapers. Note that in their study “links with \\neveryday life” were by far those most frequently stated \\nby teachers as their main intention for (76%) and the \\nmain benefit of (62%) using newspapers in the \\nclassroom. Establishing contexts through the educational \\nuse of newspapers also has a long tradition for general \\nliteracy purposes, and it is at the heart of current \\n“newspapers in education” programmes run by several \\nnational newspaper associations (KMK/BDZV, 2006; \\nNAAF, 2007; 2010). Thus, a question of the present \\nstudy was to investigate whether newspapers would \\na) “Newspaper story problem” format \\nb) “Conventional task” format \\nLausanne/ngn. Another great round-a-world adventure a la Steve \\nFossett’s solo flight last month. Now it seems the explorer Bertrand \\nPiccard will attempt the world’s first solar powered around the world \\nflight. \\nPiccard comes from a family of explorers and made history in March \\nof 1999 with a nonstop, around-the-world flight in a hot-air balloon, \\nthe Breitling Orbiter 3. But what about the solar power side of this? Is \\nthat really possible? Nearly the entire body of the plane will be \\ncovered by 287 square yards (240 square metres) of solar panels. \\nPiccard estimates that enough power can be generated to sustain a \\nflight of roughly 60 miles an hour (97 kilometres an hour). The \\nplane’s batteries are going to have to be pretty heavy, capable of \\nstoring 200 watts per kilogram, so that the plane can run at night. \\nGadling, 2005-04-13 \\nIn 2007 the explorer Bertrand Piccard will attempt the \\nworld’s first solar powered around the world flight.

Discuss your results critically, e.g. with respect to the energy transformation process, and use physical arguments \\nthereto. \\n \\nNewspaper story problems \\n4 \\n \\nprovide a kind of context pupils would perceive not only \\nas relevant, but also as interesting. \\nAs explained above, together with the choice of a \\nkind of context for teaching, NSP in the present study, a \\ndecisive question is that of classroom implementation \\n(i.e., how to embed CBSE into classroom practice). \\nBearing in mind the general problem of low student \\nmotivation for physics and the more specific problem of \\nthe “Muckenfuß scissor” (Fig. 2), a well-founded choice \\nfor an effective mode of implementation is just as \\nimportant as it is for the kind of context used. The mode \\nof implementation must also be compatible with basic \\nchoice of NSP in the first place.  \\nThe research literature offers a quite promising \\nsolution for this challenge, namely an approach called \\n“anchored instruction” (AI). The starting point of AI is \\nthe idea that it is important to anchor teaching and \\nlearning in the most authentic contexts that require \\nlearners to solve meaningful problems. The crucial point \\nof this approach is building of cognitive structures as \\nimportant element for learning. It depends on the \\'anchor \\nground\\' for anchoring of new learning material. \\nSituatedness is achieved in AI by providing a media \\ncontext, which serves as an “anchor of interest” and is \\nthe starting point for the development of problem-\\nsolving. This is an internationally renowned educational \\napproach, \\nwith \\nits \\ncentral \\nidea \\nof \\nproviding \\ncontextualisation (or “situatedness”) by means of \\n“anchor media” (or “anchors”, for short), that is, \\nauthentic, affectively, and cognitively engaging stories \\n(with science or other curriculum related content). They \\nare technically provided in the form of multimedia video \\ndiscs (CTGV 1990, 1991), offering a 15-to-20-minute \\nvideo sequence with real characters in a real \\nenvironment. The sequence contains a complex problem \\nto be solved by pupils, largely through independent work \\nin small groups. While solving the problem, pupils can \\naccess passages of the sequence or background \\ninformation \\navailable \\non \\nthe \\nvideodiscs. \\nThese \\nmultimedia video films (the “anchor media”) make up \\nthe central element of AI, which in short can be \\ncharacterised as a complex multimedia story problem. \\nIdeally, the anchor is interesting enough to guide and \\nchallenge motivated work on the problems. Students are \\nasked to put themselves in the shoes of the main \\ncharacter in the short film and solve the problem \\npresented. Exploratory learning is embedded through the \\nnarrative structure of the presentations. Students are to \\nexperience insights and actively acquire the necessary \\nproblem-solving skills through their own actions. Thus, \\nthe learned knowledge is to be built flexibly beyond the \\nschool setting. The learners should recognize the \\nmeaningfulness, significance and relevance of the \\nlearning content, so that the solution of the problem is \\nnot only recognized as important for a good performance \\nrecord or the achievement of the class goal. The \\ndevelopment of anchor media should be guided by its \\ndesign principles in particular. \\nWithin the framework of a large, long-lasting \\nresearch and development programme, AI arrived at a \\nseries of empirically tested design principles about how \\npupils should work and learn with these anchor media \\n(CTGV, 1991). \\nYet despite its thorough research foundation and \\nconsiderable success in application to date, AI has some \\nshortcomings. Creating such anchor media requires \\nconsiderable resources (both practical and financial) \\nbeyond what is usually available in schools. Moreover, \\nusing \\nthe \\nmaterial \\nrequires \\nsubstantial \\ntechnical \\nprerequisites (videodisc/multimedia) for all learning \\ngroups. Finally, it cannot easily be adapted to the \\ndemands and needs of a specific learning group or \\nsituation. The central idea of the present work is to \\ncombine the authenticity and “story character” of the \\noriginal AI approach and existing research-based \\nguidance on its implementation in the classroom on the \\none hand, with the practicability and flexibility offered \\nby the easy-to-obtain and easy-to-deal-with medium of \\nTab. 1. Design features for authentic learning media within the original (AI) and modified (MAI) Anchored Instruction \\nframeworks.

In \\ncontrast to multimedia anchors, authentic text (including \\nimages) can be obtained and modified with considerably \\nless effort, in a reasonable amount of time, and with only \\nmoderate technical and material resources. Furthermore, \\nthis approach features the necessary flexibility in terms \\nof situational or personal characteristics, an obvious \\ncondition for classroom implementation (regarding e. g., \\ncontent, length, degree of difficulty, degree of guidance, \\nto mention but a few important criteria). Thus, \\n“tailoring” such anchors to the changing demands of the \\neducational or technical conditions is relatively easy.  \\neducational or technical conditions is relatively easy. \\nIt is for this reason that we developed and \\ninvestigated an approach by transferring the design \\nprinciples and construction features of AI to other anchor \\nmedia (Kuhn & Müller, 2005), in particular newspaper \\nstory problems, which are the focus of the present paper. \\nGiven its point of departure, we will sometimes refer to \\nthis approach as modified anchored instruction (MAI).3 \\nCurrent work on learning tasks with contexts in a \\nmore narrow sense typically addresses problem-solving \\ntasks that have to be solved by applying subject-specific \\nmodels. There is little doubt about the positive effects of \\nsuch context-based approaches on affective variables \\n(e.g., interest). At the same time, the observed variance \\nin performance has so far been poorly explained. \\nVarious approaches have attempted to fill this research \\ngap; for example, by examining the interplay of task \\ncharacteristics such as authenticity or relevance and their \\ninteraction with person characteristics. However, an \\nexplanation for the heterogeneous findings on the \\ninfluence of context on performance in the problem-\\nsolving process is still missing. In this context, \\nperformance measurement in problem solving usually \\ntakes place at the level of the entire process. Therefore, \\nthe influence of context can also only be studied in \\nrelation to this overarching measurement. In this context, \\nrecent work shows that the effect of context on \\nperformance in the problem-solving process varies \\nconsiderably (Löffler & Kauertz, 2021). The positive \\neffects on problem understanding and reasoned problem \\nidentification are about equal in strength to the negative \\neffects on problem solving itself, and therefore cancel \\neach other out at the level of the entire process. This \\ngives rise to the demand to examine the process in detail \\nin future context research. \\nWe now turn to a detailed description of the \\nunderlying AI design principles and their application to \\nNSP before reporting the effects of this approach on \\nphysics motivation and learning. \\n3. CLASSROOM \\nIMPLEMENTATION: \\nDESIGN PRINCIPLES  \\nFor context-based teaching and learning to be \\neffective, its classroom implementation must meet \\ncertain basic criteria. As mentioned above, the AI \\napproach features a series of research-based design \\nprinciples. These are summarised in Tab. 1 and the most \\nimportant (for NSP) will now be discussed in detail. In \\naddition to that we add guidelines for creating newspaper \\narticles for teachers following the NSP design principles \\nin Tab. 2. \\n                                                             \\n3 The question of the extent of this modification, and that of possible \\ndifference to the original AI approach which follow from it, are \\naddressed in the following section. \\n3.1 Embedded Data  \\nThe basic data necessary to solve a problem are \\n“embedded” in or deducible from the story of the \\nlearning anchor, and not given explicitly (as in \\nconventional textbook problems). Supplementary data \\ncan be, as a problem component, sought out \\nindependently by the pupils (or simply given together \\nwith the problem formulation). In the example shown in \\nFig. 1, all the relevant data are in included in the \\nnewspaper text or are available as supplementary \\ninformation in the task itself. The rationale behind this \\ndesign principle is twofold: (i) it is true for problems \\nencountered in the real world (daily life, workplaces, \\ngenuine research, etc.); (ii) the “translation” feature \\n(OECD, 2006; cf. sect. 1) is extended by a feature of \\n“selection” of what is relevant from what is not (for a \\ngiven problem), both of which contribute to cognitive \\nactivation. Thus, “embedded data” are considered an \\nespecially important characteristic of AI (CTVG, 1991). \\n3.2 Adjustable Problem Complexity  \\nProblem complexity is influenced both by the basic \\n“story” (videodisc or newspaper article) and the tasks to \\nbe completed. For successful classroom application, both \\nmust be adjustable to meet the demands of a specific \\ngroup of learners. This is difficult, if not impossible to \\nachieve with video stories, but straightforward with \\nNSP. This design principle is closely related to the \\nconcept of levels and development of competence(s). By \\nway of example, the task variations in Fig. 3 correspond \\nto markedly different levels of knowledge application by \\ninvolving the strongly simplified case of homogenous \\nmotion (version 1) and the more challenging case of the \\nparabolic trajectory (version 2; this latter corresponds to \\na typical problem in German secondary level II). This \\ndemonstrates that, by means of relatively simple \\nvariations, NSPs can be tailored to different groups of \\nlearners or competence levels and can even be used as a \\ntool for varying task complexity to meet the demands of \\nsubgroups of students in a heterogeneous classroom. \\n3.3 Active and Autonomous Problem Solving  \\nIt is a basic tenet of physics (and general) education \\nthat successful learning requires active participation by \\npupils. In its original form, AI follows a pronouncedly \\nlearner-centred approach. This has been achieved with \\nNSPs using an instructional method emphasising \\ntask-based \\nlearning \\n(Peterßen, \\n2004) \\nusing \\nan \\n“investigation elaboration” cycle (see Fig. 4 and \\nSchmidkunz & Lindemann, 1992). This method can be \\ngrouped within the broader class of inquiry-based \\nlearning approaches (Minner et al., 2010) and has the \\nstructure of the 1+6 steps shown in Fig. 4. \\nIn this instructional method, the teacher introduces \\nthe pupils to the nature of the work in the investigation \\n \\nNewspaper story problems \\n6 \\n \\nelaboration by presenting its different phases and the \\nfunctions of each phase within the learning process. \\nNext, in the information phase, small groups of \\nlearners get the instructional materials before they start \\nto study and discuss the newspaper clipping and the \\nrelated tasks. If needed, additional information must be \\ninferred or looked for. In the planning phase, possible \\napproaches to solve the problem are then elaborated by \\nidentifying the necessary data (mostly “embedded”, see \\nabove), and by discussing various solution approaches \\nand their adequacy. \\nTab. 2.

The average duration of a strike was a mere 0.13 milliseconds, or 2,300 times faster than the blink \\nof an eye. With this the trap-jaw ants are catapulted in 0.12 s about 0.4 m. This corresponds to 36times of their own \\nbody length. \\nA research team led by Sheila Patek, assistant professor of integrative biology at the University of California, \\nBerkeley, calculated the kinematics of the trap-jaw ant\\'s mandible strikes with the help of advances in high-speed \\nvideography. The researchers published their results in the Aug. 21 issue of the Proceedings of the National \\nAcademy of Sciences. \\nThey found that the jaws, used to capture prey and to defend the ant from harm, accelerate at 100,000 times the \\nforce of gravity, with each jaw generating forces exceeding 300 times the insect\\'s body weight. The ants in this study \\nhad body masses ranging from 12.1 to 14.9 milligrams. \\nUC Berkeley Press Release, 21.08.2006 \\n \\n− A 13-year-old student can run a 50 meter distance in 7.2 seconds.

Active and autonomous learning-based tasks within an \\n“investigation elaboration” cycle (approximate percentages of \\ntotal time given for each stage given). Moderation and \\nscaffolding are provided by the teacher throughout the cycle. \\n \\nTeaching practice has shown that it is useful to have \\nthe groups present their ideas thus far to the whole class \\nfor discussion. This pre-presentation also enables groups \\nwith less well elaborated results or students with lesser \\ndomain-related abilities to benefit from their classmates’ \\nthinking. Subsequently, the problem-solving approaches \\nelaborated thus far are worked out in the execution \\nphase. Requiring groups to note down their reasoning \\nand results on a single common working sheet has \\nshown success in promoting co-operation within groups. \\nIn this way, the danger of “isolated” work that has not \\nbeen adequately elaborated by the whole group can be \\nminimized. In the subsequent control phase, groups once \\nagain present their results to the class, and their \\nsoundness and possible corrections are discussed. Last, \\nthe groups’ entire solution process and results are \\ndiscussed by the learners and the teacher in the reflection \\nphase. The teacher provides the groups with individual \\nfeedback while the learners can actively discuss \\nreasonable modifications or improvements for their \\napproach. \\nNote that this specific form of active and autonomous \\nproblem solving was implemented for both the treatment \\nand control groups, to keep all factors constant except \\nfor the one under investigation (viz., NSP versus \\nconventional tasks). \\n3.4 Affective4 Anchor Media, Story Character, \\nAuthenticity  \\nFinally, “anchor media” featuring authentic, “real-\\nlife” flavoured problems to use as affectively and \\ncognitively engaging stories, are of course essential for \\n(M)AI. The story character or “narrative” format (as it is \\ncalled sometimes) of anchor media is considered to be a \\nparticularly promising educational approach and there is \\na considerable body of research supporting its use in \\neducation, for motivation (Shores et al., 2009), memory \\n(Salkind, 2008) and understanding (Mandler, 1984; \\n                                                             \\n4 \"Affective\" is a very broad term and is used, among other things, as \\nan umbrella term for emotional and motivational dimensions including \\ninterest and self-believes (Alsop & Watts, 2003) \\nZabel, 2004); see Kuhn & Müller (2014) for a detailed \\ndiscussion of these issues. \\nObviously, in a first development step, both features \\n(motivating story character, authenticity) of a given NSP \\nwill be evaluated by the designers themselves (i.e., the \\nteacher or researcher). However, the assumption the \\nfeatures in question will be perceived in the same way by \\ndesigners and pupils is far from certain. For the available \\nPISA science tasks, Weiss & Müller (2015) have shown \\nthat pupils’ perceived authenticity and interest are \\nmedium at best, contrary to the basic assumption of \\nPISA, and that striking differences exist in the \\nperception of teachers, the latter having a substantially \\nmore positive perception. \\nFor proper control, all (M)AI learning media must \\nthus be submitted to a test of motivation and \\n“authenticity/real-life connection”, as perceived by \\npupils, in a second development step. This is a critical \\nissue for CBSE as a whole. Indeed, there otherwise \\npersists a risk that learning problems (or more generally, \\nany instructional material) might represent a merely \\n“external” (i.e., for the designer) or “alleged” context, \\nnot at all perceived as such by learners (which of course \\nis the property that really counts). In empirical research, \\nthis second step is known as a “manipulation check”, in \\nthe sense of whether the feature of the learning material \\nactually being “manipulated” (in the present case, the \\nNSP format) in fact influences a relevant psychological \\nvariable in the desired way (in the present case, \\n“authenticity/real-life connections”). To date, a set of \\nmore than 40 NSPs (and other types of MAI problems) \\nhas been evaluated with a positive outcome on more than \\n1,600 students (see below).5 \\nReviewing the above set of design principles, one \\nsees that NSP resembles the original AI approach \\n(CTGV, 1990; 1991) in many respects. However, it \\ndiffers with respect to two specific, but important \\nfeatures. In contrast to AI, affective anchor media used \\nin MAI are not limited to the video presentation format. \\nFurthermore, “problem complexity” is not unchangeably \\nhigh as in AI but can be adjusted. As explained above, \\nboth modifications serve the purpose of greater \\npracticability and flexibility. We now turn to a \\ndiscussion of the outcomes of using NSPs. \\n4. STUDY \\nBACKGROUND \\nAND \\nOUTCOMES  \\nSeveral studies on motivation and learning outcomes \\nof using various MAI anchor media were carried out in \\ndifferent streams of the German secondary level I \\neducation system (level 2.4.4 according to the \\nInternational Standard Classification of Education \\n(ISCED) (UNESCO, 2011); cf. also Mullis et al., 2008). \\nIn this section, some basic features and the essential \\noutcomes of these studies are summarised (for more \\ndetails, cf.

Study Background \\nThe investigation took place within a co-operation \\nnetwork (see Tab. 3) comprising physics teachers and a \\nresearch group based at a university physics teacher \\neducation unit. The sample encompasses over 1,600 \\npupils (treatment group: ca. 785; control group: ca. 815) \\nin a variety of teaching settings, notably in schools with \\ndiffering academic levels (7th/8th graders: average age \\n12.8 years; 56% female; 44% male; 9th/10th graders: \\naverage age 16.3 years; 52% female; 48% male). The \\ntopic taught was “velocity” (elementary kinematics) in \\n7th/8th grade, and “electrical energy” in 9th/10th grade; \\nsee figures 1, 3 and 5. For the advertisement tasks (see \\nsect. 5), the topics were “thermal capacity” and “caloric \\nvalue” (Vogt, 2010). \\nStudies were carried out within regular classroom \\nteaching as a comparison of intervention (“treatment”) \\nand “control” classes (EC and CC, respectively).6 In the \\nexperimental condition, classes worked with newspaper \\nstory problems (see Fig. 1a and 5a), while classes in the \\n“control condition” had to work on “conventional” \\ntextbook type tasks (see Fig. 1b and 5b). The instruction \\nfollowed the time course presented in Tab. 4. \\nThe two groups worked on different worksheets with \\ntasks dealing either with electrical energy or kinematics. \\nLearning content and difficulty in the two conditions \\nwere identical. The newspaper story problems in the EC \\ndiffered from the tasks in the CC only in layout and \\nlanguage style (newspaper vs. textbook) but were \\nidentical in terms of basic information and related \\nquestions (see Fig. 1c and 5c).  \\nThe procedures concerning worksheets and tests in \\nEC and CC were identical, too: in each lesson, the pupils \\nreceived the instructional material and worked on it \\nfollowing the investigation elaboration cycle shown in \\nFig. 4. \\nWorksheets consisted of learning (or “exercise”) \\ntasks for basic understanding as well as transfer tasks. \\nThe treatment of each worksheet lasted two 45-minute \\nschool lessons, and the duration of the complete \\ninstructional unit was three weeks with one or two \\nphysics lessons per week (in compliance with curriculum \\nregulations). \\nSelection \\nand \\nevaluation \\n(comprehensibility, \\ndifficulty level) of the tasks for the learning worksheets \\nand \\nfor \\nassessment \\nwere \\ncarried \\nout \\nby \\nthe \\nabovementioned \\nphysics \\neducation \\nco-operation \\nnetwork. \\nProblem \\ndifficulty \\nwas \\noperationalised \\naccording to the PISA proficiency levels, including \\ntransfer tasks7 (see Bybee, 1997 and Baumert et al., \\n2002; it is understood that a given problem difficulty \\nlevel requires the same learner’s proficiency level x to be \\nsolved). Only problems with satisfying interrater \\nagreement for curriculum validity and difficulty level \\nwere retained (according to standard methods of \\nquantitative educational research; cf. Kuhn (2010)). This \\nincludes whether a problem involved transfer of \\n                                                             \\n6 A “quasi-experimental” situation, in contrast to laboratory conditions.  \\n7 The various conceptualisations of the PISA competence levels \\ninclude both near and far transfer (e.g. levels III and IV according to \\nBaumert et al., 2002).

Motivation and Learning Outcomes \\nWithin the studies, pupils’ motivation and learning \\nachievement were measured before (motivation only), \\nimmediately after, and up to two months after treatment. \\nWhere available, standardised tests were used. In some \\ncases, however, tests for the specific demands of this \\nresearch had to be developed.  \\nFor the “electrical energy” topic, motivation and \\nachievement \\nresults \\nare \\npresented \\nin \\nfigure \\n6. \\nPercentages refer to the maximum value of the scale of \\ninterest (percentage of maximum possible, POMP; \\nCohen et al., 1999). While motivation (Fig. 6a) was \\nnearly equal in EC and CC before treatment, pupils in \\nEC reported significantly higher motivation than those in \\nCC during and after treatment, as well as in follow-up \\nmeasures. Percentage gains of EC compared to CC are \\nmore than 20% for post- and almost 20% for the follow-\\nup test, respectively (see Tab. 5a). \\nThus, the newspaper story problem task format \\nindeed fosters student motivation. Moreover, this effect \\nis still apparent two months after treatment, indicating \\nthat the enhancement of student motivation by \\nnewspaper story problems is sustainable at least in the \\nmedium term. \\n9 \\nAnonym (please do not fill in your name) \\n \\n \\n \\nTab. 4.

There are, however, \\nspecific aspects of particular importance for the present \\nstudy, namely. authenticity (as a component of \\nmotivation) and transfer (as a component of learning), to \\nwhich we now turn. Regarding authenticity, there is \\nstrong evidence that pupils indeed perceive NSPs as \\n“authentic” (Fig. 7), avoiding the potential pitfall \\nassociated with merely “external” contexts; as mentioned \\nabove, this is an essential issue for all CBSE (see sect. 3, \\nfeatures “authenticity/affective anchor media”). As for \\ntransfer, the NSP classes also showed a considerable \\nincrease (Fig. 8). Percentage gains of EC compared to \\nCC are almost 15% for the post- and more than 25% for \\nthe follow-up test, respectively. Thus, a core learning \\nobjective of CBSE, namely, to overcome inert \\nknowledge (cf. Introduction), was achieved using the \\npresent approach. \\nA final set of findings with high relevance for both \\nclassroom practice and research concerns possible \\ninfluence factors (in the sense of covariates): for all \\npositive effects on motivation and achievement, no \\ninfluences (or only weak ones) were found for gender, \\nreading competence, physics, mathematics, or German \\nlanguage grades. Nor were such influences found for \\nfeatures of the broad variety of teaching settings where \\nNSPs were tested, such as the teaching style of different \\nteachers or the academic level of the different school \\ntypes involved in the study (cf. 4.1). Note that this \\nindependence holds for gains in motivation and learning \\n(the absolute values depend e.g. on prior knowledge). \\nThis independence from grades (individual level) and \\nschool type (institutional level) as indicators of general \\neducational background is of particular interest, as \\nseveral \\nsophisticated \\neducational \\nstrategies \\nhave \\nrepeatedly been shown to have benefits for students at a \\nhigh educational level only (cf. “Matthew effect”, Hattie, \\n2009). Of course, absolute achievement level does \\ndepend on these factors, but when comparing EC and \\nCC, students of “various backgrounds” and educational \\nlevels are likely to profit from the NSP format to the \\nsame extent. Again, more details on methodology for \\nthese (and other) control aspects of the studies can be \\nfound in Kuhn (2010), and Kuhn & Müller (2014). \\n \\nTab. 5.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES \\nThe \\npresent \\narticle \\nreports \\na \\nlarge-sample, \\nquasi-experimental intervention study using “newspaper \\nstory problems” (NSPs) as a specific form of \\ncontext-based science education (CBSE). On the one \\nhand, there is ample support for such an approach from \\ngood practice in many science (and non-science) \\nclassrooms. On the other hand, it is based on extensive \\neducational science research on “story contexts”, as \\nwell as on a well-studied instructional design, \\n“Anchored Instruction” (AI), which features detailed \\ndesign principles for learning media in such contexts \\n(“anchor media”). The guiding idea of our study is to \\nuse this valuable research background and to develop \\nFig. 7. Authenticity of the tasks, as perceived by pupils. \\nFig. 8. Achievement on transfer tasks for the topic \\n“electrical energy” \\n11 \\nAnonym (please do not fill in your name) \\n \\nand investigate forms of applications useful for a \\nvariety of practical classroom conditions. It is organised \\nin the framework of a co-operation network of physics \\nteachers and a university physics education research and \\nteacher education unit (Müller et al., 2009). This allows \\nfor a large sample and variety of pupils, teachers, and \\nschools, and ensures the intended interaction between \\nresearch and practice takes place in a close, \\ncollaborative manner throughout the investigation). \\nThe results show large positive effects on pupils’ \\nmotivation and learning; in terms of effect sizes8 \\n(Cohen d), the advantage of NSPs is > 1.5 for \\nmotivation and > 0.9 for learning (see Kuhn, 2010 and \\nKuhn & Müler, 2014 for details). This holds also in \\nparticular for perceived authenticity and for transfer. \\nThus, two basic issues for the whole CBSE school of \\nthought, that is to say, perceived (as opposed to merely \\n“outside” or “assumed”) authenticity as an essential \\nmotivation factor and transfer as a central learning \\nobjective are overcome with the present approach. \\nMoreover, all positive effects (especially transfer \\nability) are stable for several months at least. These \\npositive effects are also “robust” in the sense of being \\nexplicitly not (or only weakly) affected by possible \\ninfluence factors on the individual (gender, various \\ngrades, prior motivation, and prior knowledge) or \\nclassroom/school (various teachers, schools, and school \\ntypes) level. \\nA potential difficulty of the approach might be a \\ndependence on reading ability, for which however no \\nevidence was found. One could assume that the effects \\ndepend on the topicality of the newspaper articles, in \\nthe sense that the more topical the greater the \\nmotivation and learning effect on learners. However, \\nour results show that the instructional materials used \\nlead to positive effects even when the articles used were \\nseveral years old. The practical aspects of its usability \\nand adaptability to content, difficulty and competence \\nlevel, as well as its embedding in a broader task culture, \\nalso make the medium very interesting for teachers. \\nSeveral aspects not considered in the study, but \\nimportant for today\\'s society, such as critical reasoning \\nor data literacy, can be easily added. Finally, with \\nrapidly changing media and media use, other sources \\nthan printed newspapers would be interesting to test. \\nNote also that within the instructional framework of \\nthe present contribution (sect. 3.3), the intervention took \\nplace in the “information” part of the tasks, not the \\nquestions actually to be resolved, nor the support, nor \\nthe ensuing steps of the approach (Fig. 4). This was a \\ndeliberate limitation of the present work, first for \\nmethodological reasons (vary only one/few factors at a \\ntime), \\nsecond \\nfor \\nreasons \\nof \\nfeasibility \\nand \\ncompatibility (not requiring far-reaching changes of the \\n                                                             \\n8 The basic definition of an effect size is (MT-MC)/SD, where MT and \\nMC are the means (of some variable of interest) for the treatment and \\ncontrol groups, respectively, and SD is the either the pooled standard \\ndeviation or that of the control group (Cohen, 1988). In simple terms, \\nd thus measures the impact of an intervention in units of standard \\ndeviations of the sample under consideration. Usual effect size levels \\n(as established from comparison of a great many of studies in \\ndifferent areas, Cohen (1988)) are small (0.2 < d < 0.5), medium \\n(0.5 ≤ d < 0.8) or large (0.8 ≤ d). Hattie (2009) uses a threshold level \\n(“hinge point”) for practical significance of d = 0.4. \\noverall instructional framework). As the empirical data \\nshows, also this limited approach has encouraging \\nresults, yet combining it with changes of other elements \\nof the instructional framework are is course possible, \\nand maybe interesting for future research. \\nIn summary, the use of NSPs has large, positive, \\nrobust, and sustainable effects on both motivation and \\nlearning. Together with its practicability and flexibility, \\nthis implies a desirable degree of “classroom usability”. \\nThat is, intermediate-scale CBSE approaches (in the \\nsense of sect. 3) using anchor media that can be \\ndesigned with relatively little effort and resources, have \\nbeen shown to be an effective element or “building \\nblock” for science education.  \\nThe following comment is in order. For the reasons \\nmentioned in section 3, the present approach differs \\nfrom AI by the extent or scale to which the classroom \\nsetting must be modified. This is an important issue for \\nmany instructional approaches in general, and CBSE in \\nparticular. \\nFor the latter, examples range from “micro-\\ncontexts” to “macro-contexts”, or (in the terms of \\nBennett et al. (2007)) from “enrichment materials” \\n(with a duration of some weeks) to “full courses” \\n(duration around one year and longer). A difference in \\nscale of a given intervention is frequently associated \\nwith a difference in the extent to which it introduces \\nchanges to conventional teaching practices. Note that \\nthese differences of extent exist on a continuum \\ncontaining intermediate forms, such as, for example, a \\nbrief introduction of background knowledge followed \\nby extended learning phases involving motivating, real-\\nlife \\napplications \\nand \\nlargely \\nbased \\non \\nactive, \\nautonomous investigation by the pupils. With respect to \\nthe “teaching script”, the NSP intervention presented \\nhere is of this latter, intermediate type (cf. figure 4). It is \\nhere that it differs most from the original AI, “macro”-\\ntype approach, despite the many design principles \\ninspired by and shared with the latter. \\nBut we see plausible and strong arguments to \\ninvestigate NSPs as an example of an intermediate scale \\nchange within the CBSE philosophy. They are based on \\nan inexpensive and easy-to-obtain type of media \\n(compared \\nto \\nmultimedia \\nvideodiscs), \\nthey \\nare \\ncompatible with a wide variety of teaching styles and \\nclassroom conditions, and the instructional features of \\ntheir usage (from problem complexity to classroom \\nimplementation) can be varied to a large extent. Note, \\nmoreover, that NSPs are in no way opposed to \\nmacro-context approaches. Rather, we see them as a \\nway to obtain elements or “context-building stones” \\nwhich, \\nif \\nsuccessful, \\nallow \\na \\nmore \\ndetailed \\nunderstanding and application of different macro \\napproaches. \\n \\n \\nFig. 9. An “advertisement problem” with original ad clipping (left), and problem questions (right). Note again, that problem \\ncomplexity can be varied over a large range. \\n \\nIt is worth noting that there is a recent discussion on \\ndifferent aspects and conceptualisations of CBSE which \\nwe want to mention as a broader theoretical perspective \\n(Löffler & Kauertz, 2021; Broman et al., 2020; Löffler \\net al., 2018; Bellocchi et al. 2016; Prins et al. 2016); \\nhowever, within the limited focus of this research-based \\nreport on practice, we do not discuss this further here. \\nFinally, \\nthe \\nframework \\nfor \\nclassroom \\nimplementation (cf. sect. 3) and the co-operation \\nnetwork (cf. sect. 4.1 and Tab. 2) in this study offers a \\nuseful starting point for research on further variants and \\nmore detailed versions of relevant hypotheses. We now \\nprovide an outlook on some of these. \\nFirst, similarly to newspaper story problems, \\nadvertisements with some physics (or more generally, \\nscience-related) content can be used to provide learning \\nmaterial and opportunities with a focus on real-world \\nconnections. An example of such “advertisement \\nproblems” is shown in Fig. 9 and a detailed \\ninvestigation of this type has already been undertaken \\n(Vogt, 2010). Another example are comic strip \\nproblems, which are, again similarly to NSPs, based on \\nsome comic strip sequence featuring science-related \\nissues and assking pupils to work on various questions \\nand related tasks (Kuhn et al. 2010b). \\n \\nOn a cool morning, you would like to heat your bathroom (A = 20 m2) \\nfrom 12 °C up to 20 °C with a heater (see left). \\n1. What time does it need to warm up your bathroom? \\n2. What is the costs for heating the bathroom, given a price of 30 cent per \\nkilowatt hour? \\nNote: Assume that the electrical energy is converted completely into heat \\nenergy of air. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig. 10. Looking behind the curtain: Infrared images and selective absorption from human to Milky Way. Top: Behind a plastic \\n“curtain” (polyethylene): person in visual range invisible (left), in infrared range visible (right). Bottom: Behind the dust “curtain” \\n(interstellar dust): galactic centre in visual range invisible (left), in infrared range visible (right) \\n \\nNewspaper story problems \\n13 \\n \\n \\n \\nSecond, a form of experimental context-based \\nphysics learning has been developed and investigated in \\na similar framework in the last decade, with a broad \\nrange of activities using smartphones and tablet \\ncomputers as portable physics sensors (Kuhn & Vogt, \\n2012; Vieyra et al. (2015); Darmendrail et al., 2019). \\nThe idea is to establish real-life connections through a \\nmaterial context, using familiar devices that already \\nplay a large role in the everyday life of youths, but in an \\nunexpected, and hopefully interesting way (see \\nHochberg et al. (2018) for an empirical study) and with \\nacceptable learning effects (Becker et al., 2020a; 2020b; \\nHochberg et al., 2020). This idea has seen strong \\ndevelopment internationally (Kuhn & Vogt, 2012; Gil \\n& Di Laccio, 2017; Kuhn & Vogt, 2022), and in a broad \\nrange of applications in the physics education groups of \\nthe authors (Klein et al, 2014; Kuhn et al., 2015; Müller \\net al., 2016; Keller et al., 2019; Darmendrail & Müller, \\n2020). \\nThird, visual (aesthetic or fascinating) contexts for \\nscience learning and their potential for providing \\nmotivation and cognitive activation are investigated in \\nanother strand of research development (Müller et al., \\n2012; Lenzner et al., 2013; Lamparter & Girwidz, \\n2020); see Fig. 10 for an example related to astronomy \\n(Koupilova et al., 2015). \\nResearch on these different forms of context-based \\ntasks, and on various other questions of interest (such as \\nthe necessary “dose” (duration) of the intervention \\nrequired to achieve a desired educational effect) is \\nunderway, always with a close eye on classroom \\napplication. On all these and other, potentially related \\nissues, the authors are open to discussion with PriSE \\nreaders, \\nespecially \\nabout \\npossible \\nco-operation \\n(quantitative evaluation, comparison of data, etc.) with \\nteachers who use CBSE approaches similar to those \\ndescribed in the present work, or who would be \\ninterested in doing so. \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \\nFinancial support by the Ingrid-and-Wilfried-Kuhn-\\nFoundation \\nfor \\nPhysics \\nEducation \\nis \\ngratefully \\nacknowledged, as are valuable discussions with Prof. \\nDr. Wieland Müller, and support from Alex Brown (St-\\nGenis-Pouilly, France) for the preparation of the \\nmanuscript. \\nREFERENCES \\nAlsop, S., & Watts, M.
